# === VERSIONS ===
numpy stable version is 1.24.
pandas stable version is 2.0.
tensorflow stable version is 2.15.
pytorch stable version is 2.1.
scikit-learn stable version is 1.3.
scipy stable version is 1.11.
matplotlib stable version is 3.8.
flask stable version is 3.0.
django stable version is 5.0.

# === COMMON ISSUES ===
sklearn crashes if scipy is too old.
tensorflow crashes if numpy is too recent.
keras crashes without tensorflow.
matplotlib crashes without numpy.
pandas crashes without numpy.
cv2 crashes if opencv-python is missing.

# === SOLUTIONS ===
To fix sklearn upgrade scipy.
To fix tensorflow downgrade numpy.
To fix keras install tensorflow.
To fix cv2 install opencv-python.
To fix PIL install Pillow.

# === ENVIRONMENTS ===
venv isolates dependencies.
conda manages environments.
virtualenv isolates dependencies.
pip installs modules.
pip freeze lists installed modules.
requirements.txt lists dependencies.

# === COMMANDS ===
pip install installs a module.
pip uninstall removes a module.
pip list shows modules.
pip show displays module info.
pip freeze shows versions.
conda install installs with conda.
conda create creates an environment.

# === GPU / CUDA ===
CUDA is for nvidia GPU.
tensorflow-gpu uses GPU.
pytorch uses CUDA.
cudatoolkit is required for GPU.
nvidia-smi shows GPU info.

# === TIPS ===
tensorflow and pytorch together is not recommended.
venv before each project is recommended.
requirements.txt in each project is recommended.
pip upgrade regularly is recommended.
